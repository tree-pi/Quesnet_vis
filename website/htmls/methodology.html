								<h2>When to use the question network?</h2>
							</header>
							<p> 
								Question network is best suited for representing the process of actively studying an topic in depth. 
								<li>
									Learning. If you are starting some learning in a new area, you may want to note down not only what people have known is available but also what is the thinking process that get people there; you may wanna collect not only what information is available but also what questions people haven't answered.
								</li>
								<li>
									Summarizing. If you want to organize your research by not merely data and conclusiong but by the logical flow of thoughts, highlighting the structures of your inquiries, spotting strength and weakness of the current state of knowledge, question network will help.
								</li>
								<li>
									Educating. If you want to let others understand a topic with the interactive Q&A form, you may lead people through some branches of question network, revealing nodes after the learner has proposed their own solution.
								</li>

								<h2>What are the elements of a question network?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>
								<b>Nodes</b> include question node and non-question nodes. A question node can be followed by either questions or non-question including answer, hypothesis, data, etc. This is because when a question is raised, very likely we cannot directly give an answer before more specification is given or before certain evidence has been collected.
							</p>
							<p>
								A node may contain more information than <b>to be shown in visualization</b>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Edges</b> specify the node type.
