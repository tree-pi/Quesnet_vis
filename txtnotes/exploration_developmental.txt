Wishful thinking: predicting the rewarding outcome over the unrewarding, in the Wenke et al. egg prediction task.

But this pattern stops when us kids reaches 6-7 yrs, not Peru kids tho. Related to the safety perception in the environment: Tottennham et al. shows that parents' accompanion will enable kids to explore the stimuli related with aversive CS+.

So it's more than "beneficial exploration"...but also "generalized courage" from an overall safe feeling.
