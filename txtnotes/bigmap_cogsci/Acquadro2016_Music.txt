What are the questions in social neuroscience?
	_a_ "uncover the neural underpinning of the human social behavior from both an individual and a dynamical perspective."
		_specify_ What type of brain activity will be recognized as result of social interaction?
			_a_ emerging brain coupling characteristics.
				_ How to measure it?
					_a_ Hyperscanning: brain scanning of two or more individuals while they are interacting. 
						_ What brain scanning method has been used?
							_a_ fMRI (Montague, 2002; Babiloni et al., 2012; Cui et al., 2012), EEG (Babiloni et al., 2006;Kawasaki et al., 2013; MÃ¼ller and Lindenberger, 2014), nIRS (Funane et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2015)
								_ What are the advantage and disadvantage to these methods?
									_a_ For EEG: better temporal resolution as well as enabling study in ecological situations.
				_specify_ What are the brain networks that may contribute to social interaction?
					_a_ the mirror neuron system (MNS) and the mentalizing network (MENT).
						_caveat_ recent research challenges the existence of the MNS in humans (Lingnau et al., 2009).
		_specify_ What are the types of social activities?
			_a_ observation condition, turn-based interaction(e.g. actors) and continuous interaction (e.g. ochestra).
