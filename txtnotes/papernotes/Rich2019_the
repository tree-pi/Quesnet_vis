#[E] The Limits of Learning: Exploration, Generalization, and the Development of Learning Traps

What is learning trap?
	_a_ stable false beliefs despite extensive experience.
		_ What are the different types?
			_a...
			... Trapped by noise.
			... Trapped by similarity.
			... Trapped by selective attention.
			end_
				_ Is there a unifying account?
					_a_ Trapped by simplicity. "an agent comes to believe the environment has a simpler structure than it truly does, which prevents it from exploring further to come to a more complex, more correct belief."
						_ What computer simulation can replicate this phenomena?
							_ What is the algorithm?
								_a_ Categorization learning model #[E]ALCOVE modified for reinforcement learning. 
									_ What are the advantages of #[E]ALCOVE?
										_a...
										... Easily modified for the RL task.
										... Shares deep connection with previous models used to study different types of learning trap.
										end_ 
									_specification...
									... What is the reward?
										_a_ given by the external environment.
									... What is the policy?
										_a_ soft max depending on the output node activation.
									... What is the training process?
										_a_ only for the action chosen will receive reward. Then update according to ALCOVE. 
									... What are the model parameters?
										_a_ atttention learning rate 0.1, etc.
									end_
							_ What is the hypothesis?
								_hypothesis...
								... The partial feedback is neccesary for forming the learning trap.
									_operationalize_ What is the indenpendent variable?
										_a_ Manipulate the reward feedback to be either contingent information (only the selected action receives feedback), random information (50% trials receive feedback independent of choice) or full info (all actions' feedback are given).
								... The selective attention is neccesary for forming the learning trap.
									_operationalize_ What is the indenpendent variable?
										_a_ Remove the attention in ALCOVE, all others equal.
								... The constructivist coding (updating the unchosen options) may intensify the learning trap.
									_operationalize_ What is the independent variable?
										_a_ Assigning negataive feedbacks for all the unapproached prospects.
								end_

							_ What is the task?
								_a_  A multi-bandit task with each state having 4 dimensions of binary feaures. The agent aim to maximize reward.

							_ What is the behavior?
								_operationalize_ How to evaluate?
									_a_ The proportion of simulations perfectly following either the correct two-dimensional rule or single dimensional rule in the test set.
										_ What is the result?
											_a_ Contingent feedback with attention ends up having 1/4 of all simulations in the learning trap (only make decision depending on 1 dimension). The constructivist coding results in 50% learning trap and very few successful learning.
								
	_ Do people show this behavior?
		_ What is the task?
			_a_ Bee hive harvesting task followed by test phase.
		_ What is the hypothesis?
			_hypothesis_ People will fall into learning trap if no full information is provided.
				_operationalize_ What is the independent variable?
					_a_ In contingent condition, no feedback is provided if a hive is not harvested; in full-information condition, all hives' feedback are provided.
				_ What is the result?
					_specify...
					... How to evaluate?
						_a_ The proportion of simulations mostly following either the correct two-dimensional rule or single dimensional rule.
					... How to compare conditions?
						_a_ Bayesian parameter estimation approach (Bayesian equivalents of standard two-sample t and z tests).
							_ How is the Bayesian model fited?
								_a_ Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling with Stan.
					end_
						_a_ In contingent condition, about 40% participants ends up in the learning trap and about 20% in perfect learning; in full information condition, the tendency into learning trap is far lower.
							_ Do two conditions show significant difference?
								_a_ yes.	
							_ How good do the models fit?
								_a_ The constructivist coding model fits best.
							_ What intervention may stop this behavior?
								_ What are the hypothesis?
									_hypothesis...
									... Individuating each example.
									... occlude some dimensions.
									... Increase noise.
