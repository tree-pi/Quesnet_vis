What is everyday activity (EA)?
	_ What are examples of everyday activities (EA)?
		_a_ cleaning up, setting tables, etc.
	_ What are the theoretical features?
		_a_ Hierarchical task structures. 
		_a_ Complicated interaction in sub-tasks.
		_a_@[R]Laird one-shot learning for new tasks.
	_ Why study everyday activities?
		_specify...
		... What is the societal benefit?
			_a_ Aging population have problem performing EA independently.
		... What is the academic benefit? 
		 	_a_ able to examine in the lab but complex enough to be interesting. Also forsters understanding from different field perspectives: developing, disease, etc.
		end_
			_ Who are the researchers?
				_a_ integrated research center: https://ease-crc.org/
			_ What do we want to achieve?
				_ What do we want to able to engineer?
					_a_ a robot able to do interactive learning.
						_ What are the difficulties?
							_a...
							... The instruction is diverse: could be procedures, could be merely the objection, could be an optimization problem.
							... To learn a new task fast, need to reuse the old memory.
							end_
						_ What are the solutions we have?
							_a_ "Rosie" system based on the SOAR cognitive architect.
				_ What do we want to understand?
					_a...
					... What is the mechanism.
					... Why it breakes down sometimes.
					end_
						_ What are the difficulties in EA?
							_ What are the aspects?
								_a_ Perception (is that green ring a plate?), saptial reasonings (where to mob? where to put the plates?), planning(which order to brew the tea?), controlling, monitoring and correction (did you throw egg shell into the pan?).
							_ What are the specific challenges?
								_a_ Actions are conditioned on the context.
								_a_ Interruptions may mess up your execution.
						_ What are the kinds of break-downs?
							_a_ The severness of errors: overtly error, micro error.
							_a_ In terms of subtask: Omissions; Comission errors: substitutions, wrong sequences...
								_ How are these errors correlate with neural anatomical features?
