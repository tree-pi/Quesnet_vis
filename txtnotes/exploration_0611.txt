Deep exploration model
- Based on mental simulation for the future to decide if do exploration now.
- Two kinds of exploration: Directed exploration which based on the current info; Random exploration just adding more noise (bigger slope aka flatter in the exploration probability curve).
	- similar distinguishment: Narrow, low-temperature search and Broad, high-temperature.
- Sample deeper into the future exploration, more directed exploration (more based on current best option).
	- but is there an optimal step of simulation?


Criticism: This exploration is not learning anything about the world but rather optimizing the reward.
