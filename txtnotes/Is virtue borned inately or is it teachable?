				_answer_ meno: to desire noble things and be proficient at securing them.
					_follow-up_ me: what is noble? 
					_follow-up_ me: why things? "sounds like something external. isn't virtue about being someway for oneself?"
					_follow-up_ Socrates: but everyone wants good things? how is one desire different from another?
						_answer_ Meno: ok no difference. So as long as you securing it in the right way, in a just, wise way...

			_follow-up_ Me: You are saying different social roles require different virtue. Why certain role requires a virtue?
				_answer_ Mine: it's useful and it's achievable. Former is shaped by the external world while latter is bound by innate qualities.
	_assist_ Socrates: Do we see virtuous people able to teach their sons to be as good?
		_answer_ No. Indicating it's not so teachable.
	_assist_ Socrates: Isn't virtue a part of wisdom, which should be taughtable? "unclear about this section..."
	_answer_ Socrates: Either. So it has to be a divine ability....

	_metaquestion_ Why care about this?
	_metaquestion_ If we do not know what we are search for, how can we know if we alredy find it?
		_answer_ Me: we either know the correlates, or the down-stream effects of what we are looking for. "Say, we don't know what is virtue but we are able to classify different behaviors as virtuous or not. So we have the specified examples and we are searching for something of higher level abstraction to unify the examples. It is like searching for a model to explain your data: you do have criteria to judge if you've got a good model or not."
		_answer_ Socrates: soul is immortal and learning is just recollecting.
