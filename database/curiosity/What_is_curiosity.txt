What is curiosity?
	_specification_ What is the time scale of curiosity?
		_answer_ lifelong (personality trait). ""[]
			_follow-up_ Is curiosity a stable trait?
				_answer_ Probably not.[Kashdan et al. 2004]

		_answer_ seconds (state).""[]
		_follow-up_ What is the operationalized definition?
			_answer_ Melbourne Curiosity Inventory (MCI). "20-item trait and state curiosity subscales."[Naylor 1981]
			_answer_ State-Trait Personality Inventory (STPI). "10-item trait and state curiosity subscales; includes trait and state scales for other characteristics (i.e., anxiety, anger, & depression)"[Spielberger 1979]

	_answer_ a motivator of exploratory behavior. [Grossnickle,2016]
		_definition_ What is "exploratory behavior"?
			_follow-up_ What is the operationalized definition?
				_answer_ Choosing the door without knowing what is inside. A task adapted from Harter and Zigler (1974). [Gilmore and Cuskelly, 2011]
		

	_answer_ a need for information. [Grossnickle,2016]
		_distinguishment_ Further distinguishement between need for information in different scenarios?
			_answer_ Instrumental information sampling and non-instrumental information search. "People may need information to reduce uncertainty relevant to a familiar task(information sampling), or investigate to discover new tasks (information search)" [Gottlieb and Oudeyer 2018]
				_follow-up_ What animals are capable of information sampling?
					_answer_  crabs (Zeil, 1998), bees (Gould, 1986; Dyer, 1991) ants (Wehner et al., 2002), and moths (Vergassola et al., 2007), C. elegans(Calhoun et al., 2014).
				_follow-up_ What are the task paradigms for information sampling?
				_follow-up_ What are the task paradigms for non-instrumental information search?
				_follow-up_ Do animals prefer information even if it is non-instrumental (aka useless)?
					_answer_ Yes.
						_evidence... 
						... monkeys prefer a cue that discloses the reward outcome even though they can do nothing to change the outcome.[Bromberg­Martin et al. 2009]
						... "some rats exhibit so-called sign tracking behaviours, in which they orient themselves towards a light that predicts a reward rather than to the magazine that delivers the reward".[Flagel & Robinson,2017, cited by Gottlieb and Oudeyer 2018]
						_follow-up_ How is this preference shown on the neural level?
							_answer_ reward/motivation system (orbitofrontal cortex and midbrain dopamine cells) encodes this preference.[Bromberg­-Martin et al., 2009]
								_challenge_ How is reward signal ("feeling") different from the decision signal (preference and execution)?
						_follow-up_ Computationally, why are animals motivated to gain non-instrumental information?
							_hypothesis...
							... preference to be engaged with positive things.
							... desire to early resolution of uncertainty.
							_end
								_contrast_ What are the different predictions from these two hypothesis.
									_answer_ The "positivity preference" will sample more positive/pleasurable but not the the most informative uncertainty reduction info.
								_challenge_ are these motivation, or are these merely strategy for reducing uncertainty?
									_external_ In causal inference people do employ two major types of strategy: positive testing or information gain, which matches these two hypothesis. [Coenen et al., 2015]
				_follow-up_ Why do human seek epistemic knowledge that has nothing to do with material reward?
					_

		_follow-up_ What kind of new information is seeken? <categorization>
			_specification_ What is the domain of information?
				_answer_ Physical curiosity. "The exploration and manipulation of oneself and surroundings" [Dewey 1910]
				_answer_ Perceptual curiosity. "Exploration through sensory stimulation (e.g., visual or auditory inspection) in order to acquire new information" [Berlyne 1954; Litman and Spielberger 2003]
				_answer_ Social curiosity. "The use of language to engage explorations through questions and appeals to other individuals for information" [Dewey 1910]; "a desire to know about other people"[Renner 2006]
				_answer_ Epistemic/Intellectual curiosity."A need or desire for knowledge, information, or the exploration of academic environments"[Kang et al. 2009; Litman 2010]
				_follow-up_ What is the developmental order of different types of curiosity?
					_answer_  physical, social, and intellectual curiosity develop sequentially in children from the former to the latter.[Dewey 1910 (from Grossnickle, 2016)]
			_specification_ What is the structure of information?
				_specification_ What is the number of topics being seeken for?
					_answer_ Breadth knowledge. "Curiosity about many different topics, ideas, or experiences in a constant search for variation"[Loewenstein 1994]
					_answer_ Depth knowledge. "Curiosity for ideas and experiences directed in a more sustained manner toward a single topic or area"[Levitt et al. 2009; Loewenstein 1994]
				_specification_ What is the number of connection between information?
					_answer_ Closely connected knowledge (hunter). []
					_answer_ Loosely connectedd knowledge (busy bees). []
		_follow-up_ What constitutes the motivation for information?
			_specification_ What is the internal computation for curiosity?
				_answer_ Positive prediction error. ""[Kaplan et al, 2007]
				_answer_ Learning progress. ""[]
				_answer_ Surprise. ""[]
				_answer_ The speed of knowledge value increase. "The derivative of knowledge value over exposure. Assuming 1) confidence increases with exposure until saturation -- a learning curve; 2) knowledge value is propositional to how often the subject occurs times confidence about the subject." [Dubey et al 2017]
					_follow-up_ How does this theory explain the previous studies?
						_answer_ If exposure is passive and correlates with subject occurence frequency, then "goldilock" since too few exposure means not enough but too much exposure means already well-learned; if exposure is active and independent of occurence frequency, then should always look at the new things. [Dubey et al 2017]
			_specification_ What is the taxonomy of motivation?
				_answer_ Interest-type curiosity VS Deprivation-type curiosity. "The desire to gain new information for the purpose of enjoyment or interest, or the desire to gain new information to reduce the unknown or feelings of ignorance"[Litman 2005]
					_follow-up_ Why is some information interesting? 
					_follow-up_ What is the operationalized definition?
						_answer_ For "I-type": Epistemic curiosity scale. [Litman 2008]
						_answer_ For "D-type": Curiosity as a Feeling of Deprivation Scale (CFD scale). [Litman and Jimerson 2004]
				_answer_ Diverse curiosity VS Specific curiosity. "The motive to increase arousal and reduce boredom by seeking uncertainty and new experiences; or the motive to reduce uncertainty through directed exploration of stimuli" [Arnone and Grabowsky 1992; Kashdan et al. 2009; Spielberger and Starr 1994]
